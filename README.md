# SmartPhoneStatus
An Android application designed and developed for my research, which shows the charging and power status of the phone. Logs the power to a file for further analysis.

Install the application and when you open it, the app has two tabs. Tap on the Battery tab and you can see the voltage, charging, status, temperature.
